Stay organised by creating to-do lists to help you finish what matters.

ShineProject is a modern web application which allows end users to create to-do lists to stay organised. This is a personal project which i have decided to put on GitHub.
  - This repository contains the VueJS single page application which is hosted at <https://shineproject.io>
  - This isn't a project intended to make any money, its just to provide a free service and be a good place to try out new technology.

## Sister repository
 1. You can access the .NETCore Web API which this front end website interacts with at <https://github.com/tommcclean/ShineProject-Api>
 2. You can review the endpoints available on the API at <https://api.shineproject.io/swagger>

## How to contribute
 1. This repository and its sister are open for contributions.
 2. You can contribute by documenting issues or feature requests, or by forking the repository and pushing pull requests.
 3. Your pull requests might be improvements to my architecture or code, performance optimisations or new features.
 4. Please keep pull requests focused and small, feel free to get in touch if you want ideas for how to get involved.

## Roadmap
- This project is under active development. This roadmap highlights some things I intend to add or change.
1. Continued simplification of the code base, to reduce the dependency of props through the component stack, and rely more on VUEX modules to share data between components.
2. Refactoring to adhere to best practices when I learn them.
3. Localisation of the application to support other cultures
4. Providing the ability to work offline and support PWA standards
5. Create an Alexa app which allows an end user to interact with the API
6. Create a native application for Windows that run's this front end website in a wrapper like electron.
7. Ability to add comments to todo items
8. Ability to share todo lists with other people
